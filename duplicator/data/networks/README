We have included several publically available network datasets in our package, to get you started.
Note, that we have not generated any of these datasets, and appropriate references should be cited
if the datasets are used for publication.


1. Network files contributed to Cytoscape.
The node annotation files contain the HUGO IDs that correspond to the EntrezGeneIDs.

Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) interaction mating Protein-protein interaction map. 
Using topological and GO criteria, a scoring system was developed to define 
911 high-confidence interactions among 401 proteins. 
http://cytoscape.org/datasets/stelzl.sif. stelzl.sif contains interaction file,
stelzl.na contains node attributes.
Network contains 1,686 nodes and 3,155.

These networks were ported to graphNEL format using BioNet package, function loadNetwork.sif.

2. HCSM - human cancer signalling map by Cui et al.


hcsm, rual_et_al, and stelzl_et_al are R environment files, which can loaded directly into R session:
